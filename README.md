# **PCAP-31-03 Udemy Test Code**

All the tests source code is packaged in one folder. 

Erroneous code is commented out. Feel free to uncomment to test the code/ error. 

You are encouraged to try variations of the code to see you fully understand the concepts.

Recommended Python version is 3.6 and above as a couple of f-strings are used.

The additional files for the code examples which use the file IO system and import are already created so everything should work out of the box.
