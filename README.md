# **PCAP-31-03 Udemy Test Code**

All the tests source code is packaged in one folder. 

Erroneous code is commented out. Feel free to uncomment to test the code/ error. 

You are encouraged to try variations of the code to see you fully understand the concepts.

Recommended Python version is 3.6 and above as a couple of f-strings are used.

The additional files for the code examples which use the file IO system and import are already created so everything should work out of the box.

###**Disclaimer**
The code in these files have been tested and should work as expected. All errors have been commented out but you are advised to be careful when deliberately causing errors as not to damage your system. The code in this file is provided as is and the owner is **NOT** responsible in any way for any damage that may be caused to your system as a result on incorrect use. 

Please use at your own discretion and if you do not wish to take any risk then you are advised not to use the files.
